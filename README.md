design-patterns
===============

Concise Java implementations of various design patterns.

Most of the examples were inspired by the code on the Wikipedia articles for
the design patterns.

At some point, I intend to write documentation markdown files for each pattern.

The code is intentionally succinct; access modifiers are only declared where
absolutely necessary, method chaining is used in lots of places, and the code
is formatted to fit things on one line whereever reasonable.

This isn't how I'd write code in production.

I started this project to revise for CSSE2003 Software Studio at the University
of Queensland. I intend to maintain it because I think it would be a great
resource to have in future.

Contributions are very welcome!
